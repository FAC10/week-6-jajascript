Founders and Coders, Interesting Companies App

# week-6-jajascript

### User Story 

As a member of Founders & Coders who wants to learning from interestering companies, I would like to share my suggestions with the organisation, so that we can crowdsource our connections to make it a reality. 

Thus, I should be able to: 
* add an addition to the table, including company name and why they are interesting
* see a table of results so that I don't add duplicate suggestions and can see what other people are interested in

### Requirements

- [ ] Simple web app with a node server and a database
- [ ] Your database comes with a schema, which should be documented in your readme (along with any other architectural decisions)
- [ ] Database hosted on elephant.sql, or Heroku, or locally
- [ ] Build script for your database
- [ ] Security concerns appropriately considered (you must protect against script injections!)
- [ ] Good test coverage both server- and client-side
- [ ] Content dynamic, but DOM manipulation kept to a minimum
- [ ] Mobile-first design
- [ ] Clear user journey (even if you take one of our suggested ideas, document the user journey in your readme)

### Strech goals:
- [ ] upvote feature
- [ ] accountability (assignment) feature
- [ ] prevent duplicate entries
